# The User Should Experience🦖🦕🐍🐊
- The user should immediately be prompted to enter a number between 8 and 128 for their desired password length.
- The user will then be prompted to 'say yes or no' for each question of password specificity.
- Then the password is generated based upon their prompt answers.
- Once the password is generated, the user must then click the clipboard icon to copy their new password✨.
- If the user decides that they want a different password, they can either refresh the page and follow the prompts *or* they can utilize the sites checkbox and change their password length and then press generate password🤓.
